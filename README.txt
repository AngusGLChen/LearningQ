Dataset and source code for LearningQ: A Large-scale Dataset for Educational Question Generation (ICWSM 2018).

1. How the Dataset was Collected
LearningQ is a dataset which can be used for educational question generation. Specifically, it consists of i) 7K instructor-designed questions collected from TED-Ed and ii) 223K learner-generated questions collected from Khan Academy. The source documents (i.e., lecture videos and articles) from which the questions are generated are also presented. We include the crawling code as part of LearningQ.

2. Files in the Dataset
We open-source not only i) the filtered data which can be directly used to train educational question generators but also ii) the originally-collected data from both TED-Ed and Khan Academy. The list of the data files is described as below (the number embedded in #### represents the hierarchy order of the file/folder).

```
+ LearningQ
+---- README.txt
+---- code [crawling code for TED-Ed and Khan Academy]
+---- data [the originally-collected data and the filtered data]
+----+---- khan
+----+----+---- crawled_data [the originally-collected data from Khan Academy]
+----+----+----+---- topictree.json [the full hierachical listing of Khan Academy's topic tree]
+----+----+----+---- topics [the information about each topic node in the full topic tree, each file is named by the topic's slug in Khan Academy and stored in the JSON format]
+----+----+----+---- topic_videos [the list of all videos for each topic node, each file is named by the topic's slug in Khan Academy and stored in the JSON format]
+----+----+----+---- all_video_links [the links of all lecture videos in Khan Academy, the file is stored in the JSON format]
+----+----+----+---- transcripts [the transcripts of all lecture videos]
+----+----+----+---- video_discussions [the originally-collected questions generated by learners for each lecture video, each file is named by the video's YouTube ID and stored in the JSON format]
+----+----+----+---- all_article_links [the links of all articles in Khan Academy, the file is stored in the JSON format]
+----+----+----+---- articles [the content of each article, each file is named by the article's ID in Khan Academy and stored in the JSON format]
+----+----+----+---- article_discussions [the originally-collected questions generated by learners for each article, each file is named by the article ID and stored in the JSON format]
+----+----+---- khan_labeled_data [the manually-labelled questions (whether a question is useful for learning or not) we used to build the question classifier; each line in a file is a data sample, i.e., manually-assigned label (1 for useful and 0 for non-useful) and the corresonding question]
+----+----+---- predicted_article_questions [the list of useful learning questions on articles, the file is stored in the JSON format]
+----+----+---- predicted_video_questions [the list of useful learning questions on lecture videos, the file is stored in the JSON format]
+----+---- teded
+----+----+---- crawled_data [the originally-collected data from TED-Ed]
+----+----+----+---- transcripts [the transcripts for lecture videos, each file is named by the video's YouTube ID]
+----+----+----+---- videos [the instructor-generated questions for each lecture video, each file is named by the video's title in TED-Ed and stored in the JSON format]
+----+---- experiments [the filtered data (i.e., predicted useful learning questions) which can be directly used as input for question generators, each file is named as {para/src/tgt}_{train/dev/test}, which denotes its data type, i.e., source document (para), source sentences (src) and target questions (tgt), and its usage, i.e., whether it is used for training (train), validation (dev) or testing (test).]

3. Implementation of the Question Generators
We implemented our question classifier as well as the question generators based on the following code repositories:
i) Sentence Convolution Code in Torch: https://github.com/harvardnlp/sent-conv-torch
ii) H&S comparison method: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/mheilman/questions/
iii) Attention Seq2Seq: https://github.com/xinyadu/nqg
